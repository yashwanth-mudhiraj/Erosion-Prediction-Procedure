This is a web application which allows construction managers to assess and predict soil erosion by inputting the factors which lead to soil degradation. They have the provision to create sub projects and input default values, which are calculated in the formula for soil erosion prediction.

You need to have Angular 10 and Django installed in your machine to run this project.
Along with the dependency:
pip install django-base64field

.\Erosion-Prediction-Procedure\RUSLE-app\rusle ... to start django server input the command : 
python manage.py runserver  

and then navigate to 
.\Erosion-Prediction-Procedure\RUSLE-app\ui ... to start the angular server, input the command : 
ng serve -o

The Angular app will open in the web-browser.
